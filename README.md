Challenge 4- Task Tracker

Description: doing this assignment sucked lol, there wasn't nearly enough time to do everything that was assigned and it was defintely very difficult.
### Local Storage
Local storage is broken, it populates with new tasks, but doesnt remove them properly when you click the remove button. Calling from local storage works.
### A big issue
A big issue is that you can't add more then one task, the code just wont let you add more than one. The lcoal storage can't handle it either.
Another big issue is that the card cannot move because it took me all day to just figure out how to properly get to where I got.

### Definitely if I had more time I would get it done eventually, how much time that is I have no idea but at some point it would be
### There was just not enough time to finish this Challenge unfortunately, there were just too many moving parts that you have to accuont for in the logic side of it to finish in the ~6 hours that we were given

Ken (the TA) reassured us that not finishing it was fine since the point was to see what we could get done in that span of a day so hopefully this wont impact grades too much

(Ater testing on Azure, the entire thing doesn't work so that's great)
